			<h1>T-Shirt Cannon</h1>

			<p>The team's’ lead outreach robot is the Cannon Bot, which is a repurposed FRC Robot from 2016’s game, FIRST Stronghold.
				In Stronghold, the robot was made to effectively go under, through, and over obstacles to score “boulders” into the opposing
				team’s castle. This robust drivetrain made it a perfect fit to be the team’s new outreach robot. Once the robot’s dual
				cannon system was made it was mounted to the frame after more supports were added to ensure the cannons would stay in
				place. With this robot we now bring it to events around Granville and beyond to spread STEM education and the ideals
				of FIRST while also launching T-shirts! If you want to see the bot up close make sure to catch it at the Granville trick
				or treat as well as the Candlelight walking tour. But if you want to see the bot in action, come see us at the Granville
				High School football games!
