			<h1>Fundraising</h1>

			<p>We at 4283 love to go out into the community and support robotics and STEM. We attend local events such as the Candlelight
				Walkaing Tour, Trick-ot-Treat, and Thanksgiving Farmer's Market. All of which are downtown Granville. We even won the
				"Motivate Award" at out last competition because of our involvement in out community.</p>
