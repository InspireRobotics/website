            <h1>Sumobots</h1>
            <p>
                The team’s second outreach method is from Granville Robotics are the sumo bots. The sumo bots serve a
                dual
                purpose, to show the general public amazing robots to get them involved in STEM programs themselves,
                and to
                let the members of the teams form their own groups and compete to see who can make the best bot!

                The robots are built in the off-season after FRC while things are cooling off after a very intense
                season.
                The robots are built by groups of members from both INSPIRE Robotics and Missing Parts that form their
                own
                smaller groups. Each robot is built to the specifications in the teams’ sumo bots manual. The manual
                can be
                read at this link.

                These robots are a lot of fun for the members of each team to build and for people around the community
                to
                drive, so someday we hope to make the sumo competition wider than just with the Granville Robotics
                teams!
